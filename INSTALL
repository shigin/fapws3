How to install fapws?
=====================

Pre-requisit:
-------------

Libev:
- You must have libev (and the headers) installed. For some systems that means you have to install the "-dev" package.
- sources can be found here: http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html
Has been tested with Libev-3.49 on Linux(gentoo and archlinux) and FreeBSD-6.1, and with libev-3.8 on linux (archlinux and ubunto-904) and OpenBSD (4.5 and 4.6)

Python:
- Python >=2.4. This has been developped and tested on python 2.4, python 2.5 and Python 2.6.
This application has not been tested with Python-3.x

- On 64Bits machine, Python 2.4 will not work correctly.

 
WARNING:
To avoid conflicts with the previous version (called Fapws2), better to remove Fapws2 before installation of Fapws3. 

For MacOSX users
-----------------

- Install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/
- Run "sudo port install libev"
- than follow the Fapws3 installation process described here under


Install fapws:

- execute: python setup.py install
If libev is not found in /usr or in /usr/local, please provide the correct name by updating the following environment variables:

That's it ;-).
